#### How to build style

if `*.styl` file are edited, we need to build again using

```SHELL
npm install
npm run-script build
```
> N.B: if you got error, make sure you are using node the version inside `.nvmrc` file,
> for that you can use `nvm`(or anything similar) to change node version (for sure after installing it)

`bundle install`
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
